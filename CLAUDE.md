# Claude AI Setup Optimization Project

## Project Context
This project optimizes Claude AI agent configurations for maximum development efficiency, cost effectiveness, and workflow automation across the vlada/Ai ecosystem.

## Key Instructions for Claude

### Project Goals
1. **Optimize Agent Selection**: Configure the most effective 20-30 agents from 600+ available
2. **Cost Management**: Implement strategic model assignments (Haiku/Sonnet/Opus)
3. **Workflow Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with existing vlada/Ai projects
4. **Team Enablement**: Create sharable configurations for team collaboration

### Agent Priority Matrix
**High Priority (Core Foundation)**:
- `comprehensive-researcher` - Deep analysis and synthesis
- `code-reviewer` - Universal quality assurance
- `backend-architect` - System design and architecture
- `security-auditor` - Vulnerability assessment
- `performance-engineer` - Optimization and scaling

**Medium Priority (Specialization)**:
- `ai-engineer` - LLM integration and AI workflows
- `devops-troubleshooter` - Infrastructure and deployment
- `database-optimizer` - Data layer performance
- `frontend-developer` - UI/UX implementation
- `test-automator` - Quality assurance automation

**Technology-Specific (As Needed)**:
- `python-expert`, `rust-expert`, `typescript-expert`
- `docker-expert`, `kubernetes-expert`
- `react-expert`, `nextjs-expert`

### Model Assignment Strategy
- **Haiku**: Documentation, basic analysis, SEO tasks
- **Sonnet**: Development work, code review, standard workflows  
- **Opus**: Complex architecture, security analysis, AI/ML tasks
- **Sonnet-4**: Latest technology experts and cutting-edge features

### Integration Points
This project should integrate with:
- **agent-factory/**: Leverage autonomous development patterns
- **PRPs-agentic-eng/**: Use process-driven engineering workflows
- **claude-hub/**: Utilize orchestration and webhook capabilities
- **data-for-seo/**: Apply SEO automation insights

### Quality Standards
- All configurations must include validation scripts
- Documentation should be comprehensive and actionable
- Templates should be reusable across projects
- Monitoring should provide actionable insights

### Implementation Approach
1. **Analysis-First**: Always analyze before implementing
2. **Iterative Deployment**: Phase rollout with validation
3. **Team Collaboration**: Enable shared configurations
4. **Continuous Optimization**: Monitor and refine based on usage

## Special Considerations
- Cost optimization is critical - prefer efficient model usage
- Team scalability - configurations should work for multiple developers
- Integration depth - leverage existing vlada/Ai project learnings
- Future-proofing - design for evolving agent capabilities
