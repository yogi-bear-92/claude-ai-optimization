### Known Gotchas of our codebase & Library Quirks

```python
# CRITICAL: Claude agents directory structure varies by collection
# comprehensive/subagents/*.md vs mega-pack/agents/*.md vs root/*.md

# CRITICAL: Agent frontmatter must include name, description, model
# Missing frontmatter causes doctor parse errors

# CRITICAL: Model assignments affect costs significantly
# haiku: 90% cost savings but limited capability
# sonnet: balanced cost/performance for most development work
# opus: 5x cost but maximum reasoning for architecture/security
# sonnet-4: premium cost for latest features

# CRITICAL: Context management prevents degradation
# Sessions >40 minutes without /clear cause performance issues
# Auto-clear must be configured to prevent context bloat

# CRITICAL: MCP servers require proper authentication
# GitHub token, AWS credentials, Docker access must be configured
# Failed MCP connections cause silent agent functionality loss

# CRITICAL: ccflare and ccusage require Node.js and npm
# Must install monitoring tools before agent configuration
# Usage tracking fails silently without proper setup
```

## Validation Loop

### Level 1: Infrastructure Validation (Immediate Feedback)

```bash
# Verify monitoring tools installation
npm list -g ccflare ccusage || echo "Monitoring tools missing"
ccflare --version && ccusage --version || echo "Tool validation failed"

# Verify optimal agents installation  
python scripts/agent-installer.py --dry-run --validate
ls ~/.claude/agents/ | wc -l  # Should show ~20-30 agents
claude doctor  # Should show zero parse errors

# Verify MCP server configuration
claude /mcp status  # Should show active GitHub, Docker, AWS servers
curl -f http://localhost:8000/health || echo "MCP health check failed"

# Expected: All tools installed, agents deployed, MCP servers active
```

### Level 2: Cost & Performance Validation (Component Testing)

```bash
# Test cost tracking and reporting
ccusage daily-report --format json | jq '.total_cost'
python monitoring/cost-tracker.py --test-mode --verify-calculations

# Test agent usage monitoring
ccflare metrics --last-hour | grep "token_usage\|cost_estimate"
python monitoring/usage-dashboard.py --health-check

# Test model assignment optimization
grep -r "model: haiku" ~/.claude/agents/ | wc -l  # Should show documentation agents
grep -r "model: opus" ~/.claude/agents/ | wc -l   # Should show architecture/security agents

# Validate context management
python -c "import scripts.context_manager; print('Context management: OK')"

# Expected: Cost tracking active, optimal model distribution, context management working
```

### Level 3: Team Integration Testing (System Validation)

```bash
# Test vlada/Ai project integration
for project in agent-factory PRPs-agentic-eng claude-hub data-for-seo; do
  echo "Testing $project integration..."
  cd "/Users/yogi/Projects/vlada/Ai/$project"
  
  # Verify enhanced CLAUDE.md configuration
  grep -q "optimal agent configuration" CLAUDE.md || echo "$project: CLAUDE.md not updated"
  
  # Test project-specific monitoring
  ccusage project-status --name "$project" || echo "$project: monitoring not configured"
done

# Test GitHub Actions integration
cd /Users/yogi/Projects/vlada/Ai/claude-ai-optimization
gh workflow run claude-review.yml --ref main || echo "GitHub Actions not configured"

# Test team collaboration features
python integrations/slack-notifications.py --test-alert
python templates/claude-template-validator.py --check-all

# Verify team adoption metrics
python validation/performance-validator.py --team-adoption-rate

# Expected: All projects integrated, GitHub automation working, team metrics tracking
```

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- ❌ Don't install all 600+ agents - stick to the researched optimal 20-30
- ❌ Don't ignore cost monitoring - set up alerts before deployment
- ❌ Don't skip context management - 40-minute sessions cause degradation
- ❌ Don't use opus for simple tasks - haiku saves 90% on documentation/formatting
- ❌ Don't deploy without team training - adoption failure is common
- ❌ Don't ignore MCP server failures - they cause silent agent functionality loss
- ❌ Don't modify agent frontmatter incorrectly - causes doctor parse errors
