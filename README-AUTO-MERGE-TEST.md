# ðŸ¤– Smart Auto-Merge Test - Updated

This is a test of the new smart auto-merge system. This change should automatically:

- âœ… Get analyzed by the AI intelligence engine
- âœ… Receive a confidence score >85%  
- âœ… Pass all safety checks
- âœ… Auto-merge after CI/CD completion

**Expected outcome**: This PR should auto-merge in ~5-15 minutes after creation.

**Why this should auto-merge**:
- Documentation-only change (very safe)
- Small changeset (low complexity)  
- No critical files modified
- Follows conventional commit format
- Created by trusted user

**Update**: CI fix has been applied - workflows should now complete successfully.

Let's see the AI in action! ðŸš€
